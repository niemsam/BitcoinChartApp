# BitcoinChartApp
Shows line graph and KPIs for past year Bitcoin values

Project´s idea is to filter from source data past year´s data and create a line graph of it. 
Also it will show from the same dataset specific KPI´s from specific columns. Modifying latest date in source file will change the dataset which is loaded to the chart after restart.

Project includes also functionality to save chart as an image and the dataset as csv file to current directory.
